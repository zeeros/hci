* The Ocean Cleanup

- Boyan Slat, after a scuba-diving expedition on which he saw more plastic trash than wildlife, quits his astrophysics degree and founds in 2013 *The Ocean Cleanup*
- Non-profit organization with the ambitious goal of reducing 90-percent of plastic trash in the world’s oceans by 2040.
- The most successful non-profit crowdfunding campaign to date, gaining $2.2m

* Solution

- Interceptor™ 1.0 (2017-Today) :: First prototype display multiple engineering problems
- Interceptor™ 2.0. (2018-Today) :: Second implementation brings multiple improvements and focus moves to river pollution
- System 001 - Wilson (2018) :: First cleanup system display several issues: the slow speed of the solar-powered 600-meter long barrier isn’t allowing it to scoop up plastic from the swirling trash island. The system is retired after 4 months.
- System 001/B (2019) :: The new system design addresses the problems of plastic retention and structural integrity, all in a modular fashion to ease offshore adaptations

* Scaling up

- Oceans (2021) :: Launch the improved System 002 and scale-up to the full fleet in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch
- Rivers (Today-2025) :: Since only 1,000 rivers are responsible for roughly 80 percent of riverine trash pollution worldwide, focus on only the world’s most polluted rivers

* The Ocean Cleanup's Sunglasses

- Production and selling of sunglasses is ideally a stream of revenue for the company to continue the cleanup process
- The frame and case of the sunglasses are made from recycled materials

* Criticism

- Still a proof-of-concept, far to be proven scalable
- Garbage patches contain only 3-5% of all the plastic in the ocean
- Is it diverting resources/attention from efforts that keep garbage from reaching the ocean in the first place?
